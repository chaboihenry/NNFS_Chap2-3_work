# Neural Networks from Scratch - Learning Journey

This repository contains my implementation of neural networks following the "Neural Networks from Scratch" textbook by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła. I've built everything from the ground up, learning the fundamentals of how neural networks actually work.

## What I've Learned (Chapters 1-11)

### Chapter 1-2: The Building Blocks - Neurons

I started with the most basic component: a single neuron. A neuron takes inputs, multiplies them by weights, adds a bias, and produces an output.

**Key Files:**
- `neuron/neuron.py` - My single neuron implementation
- `tests/test_neuron.py` - Tests to make sure it works correctly

**What it does:**
```python
# Single neuron example
inputs = [1.2, 5.1, 2.1]
weights = [3.1, 2.1, 8.7]
bias = 3
output = 35.7  # inputs[0]*weights[0] + inputs[1]*weights[1] + inputs[2]*weights[2] + bias
```

Then I learned how to create layers of neurons that process the same inputs in parallel, which is much more powerful.

### Chapter 3: Adding Layers

I learned how to stack neurons into layers and connect them together. This is where things start getting interesting.

**Key Files:**
- `layer/layer.py` - General layer class (list of neurons)
- `layer/layer_dense.py` - Dense layer implementation
- `tests/test_layers.py` - Tests for layer functionality

**What I built:**
- Dense layers that can handle multiple inputs and outputs
- Proper weight initialization (small random values)
- Forward pass through layers
- Batch processing (multiple samples at once)

The dense layer became my main building block for creating neural networks.

### Chapter 4: Activation Functions

This was a game-changer. I learned that neurons need activation functions to introduce non-linearity and make the network actually learn complex patterns.

**Key Files:**
- `activation_function/activation_function.py` - All activation functions
- `tests/test_activation_functions.py` - Tests for each activation function

**Activation Functions I implemented:**
- **Step**: Simple on/off function (0 or 1)
- **Linear**: Identity function (output = input)
- **Sigmoid**: S-shaped curve that squashes values between 0 and 1
- **ReLU**: Most popular - max(0, x) - simple but effective
- **Softmax**: Converts outputs to probabilities (sums to 1)

**Why they matter:**
- Without activation functions, neural networks are just linear transformations
- Different activation functions are better for different tasks
- ReLU is fast and works well for hidden layers
- Softmax is perfect for the final layer in classification

### Chapter 5: Loss Functions

Now I learned how to measure how wrong my network's predictions are. This is crucial for training.

**Key Files:**
- `losses/losses.py` - Loss function implementations
- `tests/test_losses.py` - Tests for loss calculations

**What I built:**
- Base `Loss` class for common functionality
- `Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy` for classification tasks
- Handles both categorical labels and one-hot encoded labels
- Prevents numerical issues with clipping

**Why loss matters:**
- Loss tells us how far off our predictions are
- We need this to train the network (reduce loss = improve predictions)
- Categorical crossentropy is perfect for classification problems

### Chapter 6: Optimization - Finding Better Weights

This chapter introduced me to the concept of optimization - how to actually improve the network's performance by finding better weights and biases.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Random Search**: A simple but inefficient optimization method
- **Weight Adjustment**: Randomly tweaking weights and keeping improvements
- **Loss Minimization**: The goal is to find weights that minimize loss

**What I implemented:**
- Random search optimization in `main_spiral.py`
- Only keeping weight changes that improve (lower) the loss
- Tracking the best weights found so far
- Iterative improvement over many attempts

**Example from the spiral dataset:**
```python
# Random search optimization
for iteration in range(10000):
    # Randomly adjust weights
    dense1.weights += 0.05 * np.random.randn(2, 3)
    dense1.biases += 0.05 * np.random.randn(1, 3)
    
    # Test new weights
    # ... forward pass ...
    
    # Keep if better, otherwise revert
    if loss < lowest_loss:
        print(f'New set of weights found, iteration: {iteration} loss: {loss:.7f} acc: {accuracy}')
        # Save best weights
        lowest_loss = loss
    else:
        # Revert to previous best weights
        dense1.weights = best_weights.copy()
```

**Results:**
- Started with loss ~1.098 and accuracy ~33%
- After 10,000 iterations: loss ~1.028 and accuracy ~44%
- Shows that even random search can improve performance

**Why this matters:**
- This is the foundation of training neural networks
- Real training uses smarter methods (gradient descent), but the principle is the same
- Demonstrates that neural networks can learn by finding better weights

### Chapter 7 & 8: Derivatives & Gradients - The Math Behind Optimization

Chapter 7 & 8 focused on the mathematical foundation needed for proper optimization: derivatives and gradients.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Derivatives**: How much a function changes when its input changes
- **Chain Rule**: How to find derivatives of composite functions
- **Gradients**: The direction of steepest increase in multi-variable functions

**What I learned:**
- How to calculate derivatives of simple functions
- The relationship between derivatives and optimization
- Why derivatives are crucial for efficient training (gradient descent)

**Simple derivative example:**
```python
# For function f(x) = 2x²
def f(x):
    return 2 * x**2

# Derivative is f'(x) = 4x
def derivative_f(x):
    return 4 * x

# At x = 3: f'(3) = 12
# This tells us the function is increasing rapidly at x = 3
```

**Why derivatives matter:**
- They tell us which direction to adjust weights for maximum improvement
- This leads to gradient descent (much better than random search)
- Foundation for backpropagation (coming in later chapters)
- Makes training thousands of times more efficient

**Connection to neural networks:**
- Instead of random weight changes, we can calculate exactly how to change weights
- Derivatives show us the "slope" of the loss function
- We can follow the slope downhill to minimize loss faster

### Chapter 9: Backpropagation - Backward Passes / Implementing Derivatives

Building on Chapter 7 & 8's derivative concepts, I've implemented the backward passes for all activation functions and layers. This is the foundation for backpropagation and gradient descent.

**Key Implementations:**

**Activation Function Derivatives:**
- **Step**: Zero derivative everywhere (not useful for training)
- **Linear**: Derivative of 1 everywhere (passes gradients through unchanged)
- **Sigmoid**: `sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))` (classic S-curve derivative)
- **ReLU**: 1 for positive inputs, 0 for negative (simple but effective)
- **Softmax**: Jacobian matrix calculation (complex but necessary for classification)

**Layer Derivatives:**
- **Dense Layer**: Computes gradients for weights, biases, and inputs
- **Weight gradients**: `dW = inputs.T @ dvalues`
- **Bias gradients**: `db = sum(dvalues, axis=0)`
- **Input gradients**: `dinputs = dvalues @ weights.T`

**Loss Function Derivatives:**
- **Categorical Crossentropy**: Handles both categorical and one-hot labels
- **Combined Softmax + Loss**: Optimized implementation for classification

**Example Backward Pass:**
```python
# Forward pass
dense1.forward(X)
activation1.forward(dense1.output)
dense2.forward(activation1.output)
activation2.forward(dense2.output)

# Backward pass (reverse order)
activation2.backward(dvalues)
dense2.backward(activation2.dinputs)
activation1.backward(dense2.dinputs)
dense1.backward(activation1.dinputs)

# Now we have gradients for all parameters!
print(f"Weight gradients: {dense1.dweights.shape}")
print(f"Bias gradients: {dense1.dbiases.shape}")
```

**Testing:**
- All backward passes are thoroughly tested
- `tests/test_activation_functions.py` verifies forward and backward passes
- `main_scripts/demo_backward_passes.py` demonstrates all derivatives

**Why this matters:**
- Enables gradient descent (much faster than random search)
- Foundation for backpropagation algorithm
- Allows efficient training of deep networks
- Essential for modern neural network training

### Chapter 10: Optimizers - Advanced Training Methods

Chapter 10 introduced me to advanced optimization algorithms that make training much more efficient and effective than basic gradient descent.

**Key Files:**
- `optimizers/optimizers.py` - All optimizer implementations
- Updated `main_spiral.py` with Chapter 10 training loop

**Optimizers Implemented:**

**1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- Basic gradient descent with optional momentum
- Learning rate decay support
- Simple but effective for many problems

**2. Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad)**
- Adapts learning rate for each parameter
- Accumulates squared gradients
- Good for sparse data, but can cause premature convergence

**3. Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp)**
- Improves on AdaGrad with exponential moving average
- Prevents learning rate from becoming too small
- More stable than AdaGrad

**4. Adaptive Momentum (Adam) - Most Popular**
- Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates
- Uses bias correction for better early training
- Default choice for most deep learning applications

**Chapter 10 Training Example:**
```python
# Create network with larger hidden layer
dense1 = Layer_Dense(2, 64)  # 2 inputs, 64 hidden neurons
activation1 = Activation_ReLU()
dense2 = Layer_Dense(64, 3)  # 64 hidden, 3 outputs
loss_activation = Activation_Softmax_Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Create Adam optimizer with learning rate decay
optimizer = Optimizer_ADAM(learning_rate=0.05, decay=1e-3)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10001):
    # Forward pass
    dense1.forward(X)
    activation1.forward(dense1.output)
    dense2.forward(activation1.output)
    loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    predictions = np.argmax(loss_activation.output, axis=1)
    accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y)
    
    # Print progress every 1000 epochs
    if not epoch % 1000:
        print(f'epoch: {epoch}, acc: {accuracy:.3f}, loss: {loss:.3f}, lr: {optimizer.current_learning_rate:.5f}')
    
    # Backward pass
    loss_activation.backward(loss_activation.output, y)
    dense2.backward(loss_activation.dinputs)
    activation1.backward(dense2.dinputs)
    dense1.backward(activation1.dinputs)
    
    # Update parameters using optimizer
    optimizer.pre_update_params()
    optimizer.update_params(dense1)
    optimizer.update_params(dense2)
    optimizer.post_update_params()
```

**Results:**
- **Starting**: ~35% accuracy (random guessing)
- **After 10,000 epochs**: ~96% accuracy
- **Learning rate decay**: From 0.05 to 0.00455
- **Final loss**: ~0.095 (much better than random search)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Efficient Training**: Adam optimizer converges much faster than random search
- **Learning Rate Decay**: Automatically reduces learning rate over time
- **Adaptive Learning**: Each parameter gets its own learning rate
- **Momentum**: Helps escape local minima and speeds up convergence

**Why Optimizers Matter:**
- **Speed**: Train in minutes instead of hours
- **Quality**: Achieve much better final performance
- **Robustness**: Work well across different datasets and architectures
- **Industry Standard**: These are the same optimizers used in production systems

### Chapter 11: Out-of-Sample Data - Validation and Testing

Chapter 11 introduced me to the crucial concept of evaluating neural networks on data they haven't seen during training. This is essential for understanding how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Training Data**: Data used to train the model (what the model learns from)
- **Validation/Test Data**: Data the model has never seen (to evaluate real performance)
- **Overfitting**: When a model memorizes training data but fails on new data
- **Generalization**: The model's ability to perform well on unseen data

**What I implemented:**
- **Separate test dataset**: Created using `spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)`
- **Training on one dataset**: Model learns from training data
- **Testing on different dataset**: Model evaluated on completely separate data
- **Performance comparison**: Compare training vs test accuracy

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Training data
X, y = spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)

# Train the model (Chapters 1-10)
for epoch in range(10001):
    # ... training loop ...
    dense1.forward(X)
    activation1.forward(dense1.output)
    dense2.forward(activation1.output)
    loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y)
    # ... backward pass and updates ...

# Test on completely different data
X_test, y_test = spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)
dense1.forward(X_test)
activation1.forward(dense1.output)
dense2.forward(activation1.output)
loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y_test)

# Calculate test accuracy
predictions = np.argmax(loss_activation.output, axis=1)
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)
print(f'validation, acc: {accuracy:.3f}, loss: {loss:.3f}')
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Prevents overfitting detection**: Training accuracy can be misleading
- **Real-world performance**: Test accuracy shows how well the model works on new data
- **Model evaluation**: Essential for comparing different architectures/optimizers
- **Production readiness**: Ensures the model will work on unseen data

**Results:**
- **Training accuracy**: ~96% (on data the model learned from)
- **Test accuracy**: ~95% (on completely new data)
- **Good generalization**: Small difference between training and test performance
- **No overfitting**: Model performs well on unseen data

## Complete Network Example (Chapters 1-11)

By Chapter 11, I can build, train, and evaluate a complete neural network with modern optimization and validation:

```python
# Create dataset
X, y = spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)

# Build network
dense1 = Layer_Dense(2, 64)
activation1 = Activation_ReLU()
dense2 = Layer_Dense(64, 3)
loss_activation = Activation_Softmax_Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy()

# Create optimizer
optimizer = Optimizer_ADAM(learning_rate=0.05, decay=1e-3)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10001):
    # Forward pass
    dense1.forward(X)
    activation1.forward(dense1.output)
    dense2.forward(activation1.output)
    loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    predictions = np.argmax(loss_activation.output, axis=1)
    accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y)
    
    # Print progress
    if not epoch % 1000:
        print(f'epoch: {epoch}, acc: {accuracy:.3f}, loss: {loss:.3f}')
    
    # Backward pass
    loss_activation.backward(loss_activation.output, y)
    dense2.backward(loss_activation.dinputs)
    activation1.backward(dense2.dinputs)
    dense1.backward(activation1.dinputs)
    
    # Update parameters
    optimizer.pre_update_params()
    optimizer.update_params(dense1)
    optimizer.update_params(dense2)
    optimizer.post_update_params()

# Final results: ~96% accuracy on spiral dataset!

# Test on unseen data
X_test, y_test = spiral_data(samples=100, classes=3)
dense1.forward(X_test)
activation1.forward(dense1.output)
dense2.forward(activation1.output)
loss = loss_activation.forward(dense2.output, y_test)

predictions = np.argmax(loss_activation.output, axis=1)
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)
print(f'validation, acc: {accuracy:.3f}, loss: {loss:.3f}')

# Final results: ~95% accuracy on unseen data (excellent generalization!)
```
